The goal of the project is to apply some of the methods for supervised and unsupervised analysis to a wine dataset. The work is with data characterizing the relationship between wine quality and its analytical characteristics available at UCI ML repository. The overall goal will be to use data modeling approaches to understand which wine properties influence the most wine quality as determined by expert evaluation. The output variable in this case assigns wine to discrete categories between 0 (the worst) and 10 (the best), so that this problem can be formulated as classification or regression â€“ here we will stick to the latter and treat/model outcome as continuous variable.

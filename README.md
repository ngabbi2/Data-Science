# Data-Science
Welcome to my Data Science repository, Each folder is a data science project that I have worked on. The folder has a dataset, Markdown file and html version of the analysis. If the dataset is not present it means that the dataset is available in R by default.

# Dataset Folder
This folder contains the dataset that has been used for the project.

# Markdown
The folder has the code written in R Markdown format, which can be pulled and executed locally.

# HTML 
The HTML folder has HTML version of the R Markdown document, consisting of code, output and comments along with table of contents for each project. 

# Build/Execution

Step1: Download the data from Dataset folder

Step2: Download the Markdown file and open in R Studio. Click on Execute all chunks. 

P.S: Alternate option for the execution is downloading HTML format. The HTML document has the post executed code along with output.
